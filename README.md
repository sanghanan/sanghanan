🌱 I'm a full-stack software developer who loves to build cloud-native microservices applications. I have binges where I dive into machine learning and build something neat (I wish the math didn't elude me). I live for those lightbulb moments when complex projects start coming together. Of course when things blow up along the way, I get a strange satisfaction from digging in to find the bugs!
